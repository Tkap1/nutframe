why cant we change resolution?? weird things happen

a pickup that lowers gravity until you touch the ground again after jumping/shooting

destructible blocks
a map where that ends when you collect all the shit
rocket should be drawn above player
ghost of your best run
options menu with some things:
	quick restart (r is now the same as ctrl r)
	sounds options

rockets fired leaderboard, lowest wins
reset all pickups on player reset
practice mode

jump animation
go up animation
fall animation

we have a bug where bugs are not shown until way too close. happens on the left edge of the map at least

tile that doesnt give you jumps back
spikes that go up once you step on them

we can change window size but the cycle_between_resolutions function seems to be broken
