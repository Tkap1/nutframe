TINY CREATURES:
	factorio style thing where you collect these creatures for some reason
		build bots
		bots scout around to collect the creatures
		doing so gives you resources
		resources allow you to build better bots and/or upgrade them
		there should creatures that require certain tier of bot so you want to upgrade

		maybe the goal is to get something like 5000 "resource", and that makes it so you can make some kind of alien grow, which is the goal of the game
			but getting 5000 without upgrading is basically impossible, so that's a reason for you to upgrade your shit

		maybe we also have uprades that increase the tiny create spawn chance

		maybe we have a player that also can gather creatures and can be upgraded? to make it feel less idle

		buttons aka upgrades:
				buy bot
				player damage
				bot harvest damage
				player speed
				bot speed
				enemy spawn rate
				enemy higher tier spawn
				player harvest range
				bot harvest range

				cargo size upgrade?


			bot harvest speed?
			player harvest speed?

			double yield from harvesting creatures? EXPENSIVE

		button to teleport back to base

	you lose if there are to many creatures??
	some of the creatures could attack your base?
