when player harvests creature, do some animation where the resource automatically goes to the base
	maybe the resource being harvest automatically should be an upgrade

if player kills an enemy, chance for a pickup that does something??
	like +10 resource


place a turret down?

we need a separate depth only pass that ignores pixels with alpha < 1 in order to have the shadows work properly with entity borders
dont show tutorial after it has been shown once

Maybe allow drones to get chain too, but if you want it different to the player, instead of chain, allow it to multi attack, so extra beams directly from drone to enemy.

Scrollable leaderboard.

Maybe under the 3 free upgrades have some special choices, like 2. that are random, and maybe they are able to convert points. eg.
+Player Damage x2, -Player Speed x1
Allowing you to shift your build midgame.

Maybe random honey blobs drop that you can collect giving you 5 points. might be useful early, but can ignore later.
Maybe the leaderboard screen should show your final build when you finished.

name both bars at the top, me & 5 other people thought there were hitpoints because of the red color

this is an idea i am just bouncing, what if the yellow stuff had it's own yellow laser and the damage proportional to how much nectar is stored making
player to decide if to send money or not

what if there was an upgrade that would make the queen so that she dosent attack
anymore and instead fires her laser at drones in an area "overcharging them", could be good addition for drone builds and make them move around a bit

what if ants can attack deposits and upgrade themselves

upgrades related to deposits?

how about making deposits their own struct but we make some kind of collider struct that both creatures and deposits have? then when we check for collision
	we loop over all colliders? idk
