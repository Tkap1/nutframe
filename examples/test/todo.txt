better rng

if a creature is at 1 hp and we get close and attack it, the laser wont show up because we killed it in that update,
	so when we go into render and we try to find the enemy, we wont get anything because it's dead

if we hold shift or ctrl, we should buy an upgrade x10 or x100??

when player harvests creature, do some animation where the resource automatically goes to the base
	maybe the resource being harvest automatically should be an upgrade

sounds

if player kills an enemy, chance for a pickup that does something??
	like +10 resource
	temporary buff?

win animation instead of instant change to leaderboard

smooth zoom
smooth camera movement


we need higher attack speed, kinda cringe
drone cargo upgrade

higher attack speed higher spawn rate?
 or higher attack speed higher health


place a turret down?

make shadows use the main_fbo depth, otherwise they go on top of enemies

polish:
	make defeat bar shake when it gets close?
