better rng

if a creature is at 1 hp and we get close and attack it, the laser wont show up because we killed it in that update,
	so when we go into render and we try to find the enemy, we wont get anything because it's dead

if we hold shift or ctrl, we should buy an upgrade x10 or x100??

when player harvests creature, do some animation where the resource automatically goes to the base
	maybe the resource being harvest automatically should be an upgrade
