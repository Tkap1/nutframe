when player harvests creature, do some animation where the resource automatically goes to the base
	maybe the resource being harvest automatically should be an upgrade

if player kills an enemy, chance for a pickup that does something??
	like +10 resource
	temporary buff?


place a turret down?

polish:
	smooth zoom
	smooth camera movement


bar for the win condition?

we need a separate depth only pass that ignores pixels with alpha < 1 in order to have the shadows work properly with entity borders
dont show tutorial after it has been shown once

Maybe allow drones to get chain too, but if you want it different to the player, instead of chain, allow it to multi attack, so extra beams directly from drone to enemy.

Scrollable leaderboard.

Maybe under the 3 free upgrades have some special choices, like 2. that are random, and maybe they are able to convert points. eg.
+Player Damage x2, -Player Speed x1
Allowing you to shift your build midgame.

Maybe random honey blobs drop that you can collect giving you 5 points. might be useful early, but can ignore later.
Maybe the leaderboard screen should show your final build when you finished.

name both bars at the top, me & 5 other people thought there were hitpoints because of the red color
