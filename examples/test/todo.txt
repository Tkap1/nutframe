when player harvests creature, do some animation where the resource automatically goes to the base
	maybe the resource being harvest automatically should be an upgrade

if player kills an enemy, chance for a pickup that does something??
	like +10 resource
	temporary buff?


place a turret down?

text for resource gotten
exp bar?
level display?

polish:
	smooth zoom
	smooth camera movement
	win animation instead of instant change to leaderboard
