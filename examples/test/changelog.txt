*Misc*
- Power up drops now alternate. This means that you will now get red, green, red, green. This is to reduce bad RNG where you get a bunch of the same power up
- Drones now do a circle vs rect collision against enemies to start attacking. Previously they checked distance between centers. This results in more drone range
- Drone range upgrade cost 90 -> 80
- Drone range upgrade value 20 -> 25
- Timer is on by default
- Timer no longer starts until the player performs an action
- Added a power up that gives +100 range and +4 chains to drones (same as the player's chain power up)
- Increased the maximum number of cargo upgrades 9 -> 19
- Power ups are now easier to see
- Increased the EXP needed to level in the late game
- Added an ugly display to see what buffs you currently have
- Added an option to automatically pick the most expensive free upgrade when leveling up
- Added a main menu

*Bug fixes*
- Can no longer pause while in free upgrade, which made you lose the upgrade
- Can no longer get stuck in the free upgrade menu
- Free upgrade no longer triggers when in the winning animation
- Can no longer lose while in the winning animation

*Misc*

*Bug fixes*
