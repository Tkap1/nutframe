*Misc*
- Power up drops now alternate. This means that you will now get red, green, red, green. This is to reduce bad RNG where you get a bunch of the same power up
- Drones now do a circle vs rect collision against enemies to start attacking. Previously they checked distance between centers. This results in more drone range
- Drone range upgrade cost 90 -> 80
- Drone range upgrade value 20 -> 25

*Bug fixes*
- Can no longer pause while in free upgrade, which made you lose the upgrade
- Can no longer get stuck in the free upgrade menu
- Free upgrade no longer triggers when in the winning animation
- Can no longer lose while in the winning animation
