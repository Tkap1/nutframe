why doesn't hot reloading break textures??
	we probably don't want it to allocate tho

make a config.bat

hot shader reloading

we can leak shaders if they compile but dont link
	we need some flags of what to free/delete in the load shader func

we want shader errors in game. we need text rendering for this!!

need a good way to set window size


make a default framebuffer thingie
we need to give new framebuffers a transforms pointer?
handle do depth and do additive

test if adding texture and framebuffers in any order breaks things
