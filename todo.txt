we want the equivalent of
s_transforms transforms[texture_count][blend_mode_count];


why doesn't hot reloading break textures??
	we probably don't want it to allocate tho

make a config.bat

we can leak shaders if they compile but dont link
	we need some flags of what to free/delete in the load shader func

we want shader errors in game. we need text rendering for this!!

need a good way to set window size


make a default framebuffer thingie
we need to give new framebuffers a transforms pointer?
handle do depth and do additive

test if adding texture and framebuffers in any order breaks things

why hot code reloading broken??
	is it because load_texture allocates? but it also frees in the same call, i dont think this is it

hot reloading shoudl break when we allocate something in the game layer and then reload

remove blend mode from framebuffer

embed assets in exe
